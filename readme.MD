# Scheduling Algorithm Simulator and Visualizer

To run the simulator, execute main.py. To edit the simulation you can modify the main file to meet your needs

# Preqrequisites

There are two prerequisites for the visualizer part of this project. The first is the terminaltables module to visualize what the CPUs are executing at a given time and matplotlib to visualize the misses of each algorithm. To install, execute the command below, or whatever you use to install python modules.

```bash
pip install terminaltables matplotlib
```
